    "The Water Management Data Model (WaMDaM) is a database design with companion software that uses contextual metadata and controlled vocabularies to organize water management data from multiple sources and models. The design addressed the problem of using multiple methods to query and analyze water management data to identify input data to develop or extend a water management model. The consistent design allows modelers to query, plot, compare data, and choose input data and serve it to run models.    \n",
