    "This notebook provides directions to set up and run the WaMDaM Wizard and demonstrates example use case analysis to query the Water Management Data Model (WaMDaM) database in SQLite which faciliates preparing input data for models. Active development of WaMDaM software continues at the WaMDaM project on GitHub at https://github.com/WamdamProject\n",

    "\n",
    "Many WaMDaM steps can be executed within this Notebook, other steps require actions on a local machine. The Notebooks use the Python 2.7 libraries pandas, SQLite and plotly that are aready installed as part of the Anacona Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Software \n",
    "•\tWindows 7 or 10 64 bit operating systems  \n",
    "•\tInternet connection  \n",
    "•\tMicrosoft Excel (versions after 2007)  \n",
    "•   Anaconda distribution for Python 2.7   \n",
    "•\tWater Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) (WEAP requires a license to run the model.   \n",

    "No coding or database experience are needed to replicate the work but some knowledge of coding like in Python and awareness of Structure Query Language (SQL) are a plus.   \n",

    "### Required time\n",
    "Step 1 – 2 hours to 2 days (to load large datasets into a SQLite file)  \n",

    "### How to use the Notebook   \n",
    "The Notebook reads data from a WaMDaM SQLite pre-populated file, runs SQL script for each use case, and then uses plotly to visualize the results.
