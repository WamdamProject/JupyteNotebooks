    "Besides identifying data values that describe water systems components, researchers need to identify how water supply, demand, and other system components are connected to correctly represent them in models. This use case employs the features of controlled vocabularies and the connectivity of nodes and links through networks to enable a more readily and consistent method to search for water system components and their connectivity across datasets. WaMDaM uses the Connections table to search for all links where a provided node is a start (outflow) or end (inflow) to links. For example, what links flow into or out of Hyrum Reservoir in three model scenarios in the Little Bear River Utah? We draw a schematic for each one, which visually reveals similarities and differences among the networks (Figure 9). \n",

We select the Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge (i.e., Bird Refuge site) at the mouth of Bear River as the demand site for testing the sensitivity of water shortages to changes in input of upstream supply, demand and storage. First, we executed the USU WEAP 2017 model as-is and reported the total annual estimated water shortage out of its target at the Bird Refuge site in year 2002 which was a dry year. Then we used python 2.7 script in a Jupyter Notebook to populate the selected data source directly into the WEAP model using its API. \n",
