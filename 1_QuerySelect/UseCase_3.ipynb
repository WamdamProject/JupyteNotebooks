    "Once modelers have identified data availability in Use Case 1, next they need to determine which datasets and values to use in their model. Modelers often use many data management methods to query, manipulate, and join different water management data types (e.g., time series, multi-column arrays) to analyze and prepare them for systems models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modelers also manually search for descriptive metadata stored separately in many files like PDF of HTML pages. This use case shows how a modeler can use WaMDaMâ€™s multiple data types, controlled vocabularies, conditional queries, and metadata design features to consistently query and compare different types of data values across datasets.\n",

    "Modelers may search for attributes with numeric and descriptive values to correctly understand and represent the functions of water systems like modeling hydropower in Reservoirs. In this case, we use the controlled Instances of Shasta Reservoir, California and Flaming Gorge Reservoir, Utah to identify and compare and relate their dam heights, installed hydropower capacity, and number of generators across both the US Dams and the National Hydropower Datasets (Table 5). With a 100 feet higher dam and four more installed generators, the Shasta Reservoir has a hydropower capacity at about five times of the Flaming Gorge Reservoir. "
