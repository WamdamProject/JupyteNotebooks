    "## WaMDaM Directions and Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### By Adel M. Abdallah, Utah State University, August 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "The Water Management Data Model (WaMDaM) is a database design with companion software that uses contextual metadata and controlled vocabularies to organize water management data from multiple sources and models. The design addressed the problem of using multiple methods to query and analyze water management data to identify input data to develop or extend a water management model. The consistent design allows modelers to query, plot, compare data, and choose input data and serve it to run models.    \n",
    "Active development of WaMDaM software continues at the WaMDaM project on GitHub at https://github.com/WamdamProject\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The instructions here will help you to replicate the process to \n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the WaMDaM Wizard to load 13 different water management datasets into a WaMDaM SQLite database file.      \n",
    "\n",
    "* Execute SQL and Python to query, compare, and plot example data analysis in four use cases to choose it as input to a model in the Bear River Watershed, USA.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* Serve the selected data for a fifth use case into a Water Evaluation and Planning system (WEAP) model in the Bear River Watershed    \n",
    "\n",
    "Many WaMDaM steps can be executed within this Notebook, other steps require actions on a local machine. The Notebooks use the Python 2.7 libraries pandas and SQLite that are already installed as part of the Anaconda Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to share this Notebook with others, please share this URL.\n",
    "https://github.com/WamdamProject/WaMDaM_JupyteNotebooks/blob/master/1_QuerySelect/00_WaMDaM_Directions_and_Use_Cases.ipynb\n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't share the URL of the launched live notebooks that contains (https://hub.mybinder.org.....)  as they will stop working after inactivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Software \n",
    "•\tWindows 7 or 10 64-bit operating systems  \n",
    "•\tInternet connection  \n",
    "•\tMicrosoft Excel (versions after 2007)  \n",
    "•   Anaconda distribution for Python 2.7   \n",
    "•\tWater Evaluation and Planning System (WEAP) (WEAP requires a license to run the model.   \n",
    "    If you don’t have access to a WEAP license, you will still be able to replicate all the results except for the last   \n",
    "    use case).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty level\n",
    "No coding or database experience are needed to replicate the work but some knowledge of coding like in Python and awareness of Structure Query Language (SQL) are a plus. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Options and required time**\n",
    "<font color=green>**Disclaimer:**</font> Please expect to spend up to a day of learning and work. This work has consumed 6 years of production so spending just hours or a day to learn about it and replicate it is quite amazing! choose one of the replication options\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1:  faster as it skips replicating loading datasets to WaMDaM and starts with a populated database\n",
    "    Up to ~ 3.5 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps| Activity | Expected time to complete\n",
    ":-- | :-- | :--\n",
    "Step 1.1 | Install WaMDaM Wizard | ~ 30 min\n",
    "Step 1.3 | Install and setup  local Jupyter   Notebook server | ~ 30 min\n",
    "Step 2.1 | Run Use Cases 1-3 on cloud | ~ 1 hour\n",
    "Step 2.2 | Use Wizard to compare scenarios for use case 4 | ~ 30 min\n",
    "Step 2.3 | Use WEAP and local Jupyter Notebook for use case 5 | ~ 1 hour\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: slower,  mostly computer time to load large datasets into WaMDaM SQLite\n",
    "    Up to ~2 days\n",

    "Step 2 | Execute use cases 1-5 using <br>the new populated sqlite file | ~ 3 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use the Notebook   \n",
    "The Notebook reads data from a WaMDaM SQLite pre-populated file, runs SQL script for each use case, and then uses Plotly to visualize the results. The SQL queries used in the use cases are referenced directly from GitHub to maintain a manageable and simple Notebook at https://github.com/WamdamProject/WaMDaM_UseCases/tree/master/4_Queries_SQL\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** Any changes you make to the live Notebooks are temporary and will be lost once you close it. You always can start a new live Notebook that has the original content.    \n",
